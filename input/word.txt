Animals see the world very differently, but in equally amazing ways! Scollops can have up to TWO HUNDRED eyes. And sharks are achromatic, meaning that they don't see any colours at all. But they are able to see in ultra-high contrast, so they can single out their prey amongst dark and murky waters. Eagles are able to see twice as well as humans - and can see four to five times closer than we can.

These are just a few examples of the amazing characteristics some members of our animal kingdom leverage to their advantage. Learn about these crafty creatures, and more, below. Do animals see things that humans can't? We'll find out!
